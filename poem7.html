  <br><b>The Kiss</b>
  <body>
  <br><br><br><br><p><div>My mouth blossoms like a cut.</div></p>
<p>I've been wronged all year,</p>
<p><h6>tedious nights,</h6></p>
<p>nothing but rough elbows in them and delicate boxes <br> of <a href="https://belleprnte.github.io/Assignment-1/poem6.html">Kleenex calling</a>
<br><br><br><br> CRYBABY, <br><br><br><strong>CRYBABY, </strong><br><br><br> YOU FOOL!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before today my body was useless. Now it's tearing at its square corners.<br>It's tearing old Mary's garments off, knot by knot.<br><br>and see--Now it's shot full of these electric bolts.<br><br><span style="color:orange">Zing!</span> &nbsp; A resurrection!</p>
<p>Once it was a boat, quite wooden
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with no business, and no salt water under it<br><br>and in need of some paint. It was no more <br> than a group of boards <br><br><br> But you hoisted her, <strong>rigged her</strong></p>
<p><center> She's been elected</center></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My nerves are turned on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear them like</p>
<p>musical instruments. Where there was silence</p>
<p>the drums, the strings are incurably playing. You did this</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure genius at work. Darling, the composer has stepped</p>
<p>into fire</p>
