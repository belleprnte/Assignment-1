  <br><br><p><center> <em>My mouth blooms like a cut.</em> <br>I've been wronged all year, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tedious <br> nights, nothing but rough elbows in them <br>and <h6>delicate boxes of Kleenex calling</h6> <br><h3>crybaby</h3><br><h2>crybaby,</h2><br><h1>you fool!</h1></p>
    <br><br><p>Before today my body was <em>useless.</em> <br> <strong>Now it's tearing at its square corners.</strong> <br> It's tearing old Mary's garments off, <br><br> <h2>knot</h2><br><h3>by</h3><br><h4>knot.</h4></p><br> and see-- Now it's shot full of these electric bolts. <br><h1>Zing!</h1> <br>A resurrection!
    <br><br><p>Once it was a boat, quite wooden <br>and with no business, no salt water under it <br>and in need of some paint. It was no more <br>than a group of boards. But you hoisted her, <em>rigged her.</em> <br><br><strong>She's been elected.</strong></p>
    <br><br><p><span style="color:pink"><em>My nerves are turned on</em></span> <br>I hear them like musical instruments. <br>Where there was silence <br><strong>the drums, the strings</strong><br>are incurably playing. <br><br>You did this.<br><br>Pure genius at work.<br><br><span style="color:red">Darling, the composer has stepped into the fire.</span></p>
