    <title>The Kiss by Anne Sexton</title>
  <br><br></head><em>The Kiss</em> by Anne Sexton </head>
  <body>
    <p>My mouth blooms like a cut. <br> I've been wronged all year, <li><ul> tedious nights</ul> <br>nothing but <br> <li><ul> rough elbows </ul> <br> in them and <li><ul><em>delicate boxes of Kleenex</ul><br></em> calling crybaby<br><br><strong>crybaby,&nbsp;you fool!</strong></p>
      <br><p>Before today my body was <li><ul>useless</ul> <br> Now it's tearing at its square corners. <br> It's tearing old Mary's garments off,
        <ul type="square">
        <li>knot</li>
        <li>by</li>
        <li>knot</li>
      </ul>
      <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and see-- Now it's shot full of these electric bolts. &nbsp;&nbsp;Zing! A resurrection!</p>
      <p>Once it was a boat, quite wooden <br> and with no business, no salt water under it <br> and in need of some paint. It was no more <br> than a group of boards.</p>
      <p>But you <strong>hoisted</strong> her, rigged her.</p>
      <p><br><em>She's been elected</em></p>
      <p><br>My nerves are turned on. <br> I hear them like musical instruments. <br> Where there was silence <br>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>the drums</li>
        <li>the strings</li>
      </ol>
      <br>are incurably playing. <br> <em>You did this.</em> <br> Pure genius at work. <br> Darling, the composer has stepped into fire.
