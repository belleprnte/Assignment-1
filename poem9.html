    <title>The Kiss by Anne Sexton</title>
  </head><center><h2>The Kiss</h2>by Anne Sexton
  <body>
    <br><br><p align=right> My mouth <strong>BLOOMS</strong> like a cut. <br>I've been wronged all year, <strong>TEDIOUS</strong> <br>nights, nothing but <strong>ROUGH</strong> elbows in them <br>and <strong>DELICATE</strong> boxes of Kleenex calling <h4>crybaby, crybaby, you fool!</h4></p>
    <br><br><p align=right>Before today my body was <strong>USELESS.</strong> <br>Now it's tearing at its square corners. <br>It's tearing old Mary's garments <strong>OFF,</strong> <br><br><br>knot by knot <br><br><span style="color:blue"> and see-- Now it's shot full of these electric bolts</span> <br><br><h2>Zing! A resurrection!</h2>
    <br><br><p align=right>Once it was a boat quite wooden <br>and with no business, no salt water under it <br> and in need of some paint. It was no more <br> than a group of boards. But you <strong>HOISTED</strong> her, <strong>RIGGED</strong> her. <br><strong>SHE'S BEEN ELECTED NOW</strong>
    <br><br>My nerves are turned on. I hear them like <br>musical instruments. When there was silence <br>the drums, the strings are <strong>INCURABLY</strong> playing. <br><br><strong>YOU DID THIS.</strong><br><br><strong>PURE GENIUS AT WORK. </strong> <br><br>Darling, the composer has stepped into <strong>FIRE.</strong>
